![Having a blast Vermont](/profile.jpg)  
I am a research staff member at the IBM - [Haifa research lab](http://research.ibm.com/labs/haifa/index.shtml) in the group of [Machine Learning for Healthcare and Life Sciences](http://nivab-ps.haifa.ibm.com/haifa/dept/vst/mldm_team.shtml) (guess who I am there).  
I research and teach in a variety of areas, including machine learning, deep learning, stochastic process, Nonequilibrium Statistical Mechanics and even Quantum information.
