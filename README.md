My personal website at TalKachman.github.io
====================
This repository holds all of the rendered code for my website, the source code can be find in a different repository.  
The main webpage was build using Nikola with my adaptation of the zen theme.   
The blog was built using pelican and is still under heavy construction 

*of course all of this is rendered using the awesome github pages mechanism*
